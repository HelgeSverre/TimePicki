# TimePicki
Timepicki - Simple Time picker jquery plugin

Original: https://github.com/senthilraj/TimePicki


This is a customized version of TimePicki that is used internally by [Fronttek](http://fronttek.no).


## Differences from original

- Time formatting is trimmed to be "hh:mm"/"hh:mm:ss" instead of the original "hh : mm " / "hh : mm : ss" which caused validation errors.
