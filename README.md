# TimePicki
Timepicki - Simple Time picker jquery plugin

Original: https://github.com/senthilraj/TimePicki


This is a customized version of TimePicki that is used internally by [Fronttek](http://fronttek.no).


## Differences from original

- Time formatting is trimmed instead of having spaces around the ":".
- Various CSS Fixes due to collisions in fronttek's stylesheets (should not cause any unwanted sideeffects).
- Does not include any html files or unneccesary files for the official website.
